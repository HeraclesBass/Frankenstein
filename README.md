# 🧪 Frankenstein

> "It's alive!" - A mad scientist's laboratory for experiments and knowledge assembly

**Broadcasting from:** Falkenstein, Germany 🇩🇪 | **Powered by:** Renewable Energy ⚡ | **Running on:** Hercules Platform

## What is Frankenstein?

Frankenstein is a dual-purpose repository that serves as:

1. **Experimental Laboratory** - A safe space for mad science coding experiments, proof-of-concepts, and testing new technologies
2. **Knowledge Repository** - An organized collection of scattered learnings, technical documentation, and personal notes assembled into one cohesive system

Like its namesake, this repository brings together disparate parts to create something greater than the sum of its components.

### ⚡ The Origin Story

Just as Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein conducted his experiments in Germany, this modern laboratory operates from **Falkenstein, Germany** - home to some of Europe's most advanced data centers. The Hercules platform that powers this repository harnesses German engineering precision and renewable energy to bring experiments to life. With 125GB of RAM, 12 CPU threads, and 77+ days of uninterrupted uptime, this is where ideas become reality.

**The Laboratory Stats:**
- **Location:** Hetzner Data Center, Falkenstein, Germany
- **Compute:** Intel i7-8700 (6 cores, 12 threads)
- **Memory:** 125GB RAM
- **Storage:** 906GB RAID array
- **Containers:** 58 microservices running simultaneously
- **Agents:** 48 specialized AI agents ready to assist
- **Uptime:** 77+ days of continuous operation

### 🤖 The AI Environment Weight

This isn't just a server - it's an **AI-augmented development platform** that rivals traditional 5-10 person development teams:

**Intelligence Layer:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - 200K token context window (entire codebases in memory)
- **Claude Code CLI v2.0.35** - Autonomous agent orchestration with parallel execution
- **48 Active AI Agents** - Specialized workers across 15+ domains
- **Agent Registry** - 116KB living system with 113 evolution snapshots

**Scale Indicators:**
- **320GB** of development data (excluding dependencies)
- **~651,000** files under active management
- **~8,300** documentation files (markdown)
- **~49,000** source code files (15K Python + 34K JS/TS)
- **18** active Git repositories
- **64** unique container images
- **Up to 5** parallel agent tasks simultaneously

**The 2024 Paradigm Shift:**  
What cost $500K-800K/year in traditional dev teams (5 people) is now achievable by **one developer + AI** for ~$100K/year. This transformation became possible for everyone when Claude Code CLI launched publicly in 2024.

**Development Velocity:**
- Traditional team: 2-3 parallel workstreams
- Hercules Platform: 5+ simultaneous agent operations
- Code review: Seconds instead of hours
- Deployment: Automated multi-service orchestration
- Monitoring: 24/7 agent-managed observability

## 🔬 Experiments Philosophy

**Guidelines for the laboratory:**

- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster** - Experiments are meant to break things
- **Document the Journey** - Record what worked, what didn't, and why
- **No Judgment Zone** - All ideas are welcome, no matter how wild
- **Keep It Isolated** - Each experiment should be self-contained
- **Version Everything** - Git tracks our mad science progress

**Experiment Naming Convention:**
- `YYYYMMDD-experiment-name` - Date prefix for chronological tracking
- Example: `20251107-llm-streaming-poc`

---

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

**Knowledge Assembly Principles:**

- **Capture Everything** - If you learned it, document it
- **Link Liberally** - Connect related concepts and experiments
- **Keep It Practical** - Focus on actionable insights
- **Evolve Continuously** - Update as understanding grows
- **Make It Searchable** - Use clear titles and keywords

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Starting a New Experiment

1. Choose the appropriate directory (`prototypes/`, `poc/`, or `sandbox/`)
2. Create a dated directory: `mkdir experiments/poc/20251107-my-experiment`
3. Add a README.md explaining the experiment's goal
4. Code away!
5. Document results in the experiment's README

### Adding Documentation

1. Choose the category (`guides/`, `notes/`, or `research/`)
2. Create a markdown file with a descriptive name
3. Follow the documentation template (see `templates/doc-template.md`)
4. Link to related experiments or other docs

---

## 🧬 Experiment Categories

### Prototypes
Full-featured implementations that could become real projects. These should be relatively polished and functional.

### POC (Proof of Concept)
Quick implementations to test if an idea is feasible. Focus on core functionality only.

### Sandbox
Throwaway code for learning and testing. No quality expectations - just exploration.

---

## 📖 Documentation Categories

### Guides
Step-by-step tutorials and how-to documentation. Practical and actionable.

### Notes
Personal learnings, insights, and observations. Stream-of-consciousness welcome.

### Research
Deep dives into technologies, patterns, or concepts. More structured analysis.

---

## 🔗 Integration with Main Projects

Successful experiments may graduate to:
- Production projects in the Hercules platform
- Standalone repositories
- Integration into existing services

Document the graduation path in the experiment's README.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This is a polyglot playground. Any technology is welcome:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Rust, etc.
- Frameworks: Whatever fits the experiment
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, etc.
- Tools: Docker, APIs, CLIs, notebooks, etc.

---

## 📊 Tracking Progress

Use GitHub Issues for:
- Experiment ideas to try
- Documentation topics to write
- Questions to research
- Connections to make between concepts

Use GitHub Projects for:
- Organizing related experiments
- Tracking learning goals
- Planning documentation sprints

---

## 🤝 Contributing (to yourself)

Some guidelines for future you:
- Always commit with descriptive messages
- Tag experiments with relevant labels
- Cross-reference related work
- Don't delete failed experiments - they're learning opportunities
- Review and refactor documentation regularly
