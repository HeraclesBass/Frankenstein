# 📚 Documentation

Welcome to the Frankenstein knowledge base. This is where scattered learnings become organized wisdom.

## Structure

### 📖 Guides (`guides/`)
Step-by-step tutorials and how-to documentation. Use these when you need to remember how to do something specific.

**When to add:**
- You figured out how to do something non-trivial
- You solved a problem that took multiple steps
- You want to remember a specific workflow

### 📝 Notes (`notes/`)
Quick captures of learnings, insights, and observations. Less structured than guides.

**When to add:**
- You learned something interesting
- You had an insight worth remembering
- You want to capture context while it's fresh

### 🔬 Research (`research/`)
Deep dives into technologies, patterns, or concepts. More analytical and comprehensive.

**When to add:**
- You've explored a topic in depth
- You've compared multiple approaches
- You've analyzed pros/cons of something

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Use the template** - Start with `../templates/doc-template.md`
2. **Add tags** - Makes searching easier later
3. **Link liberally** - Connect to experiments and other docs
4. **Update dates** - Track when you last reviewed/updated
5. **Status emoji** - Show maturity level (🌱 Draft | 🌿 Growing | 🌳 Mature)

## Quick Capture

Learned something quick? Drop it in `notes/` with today's date:

```bash
# Quick note capture
echo "# Quick Learning - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" > notes/$(date +%Y%m%d)-topic-name.md
```

## Index

Maintain an index of your most useful documentation:

### Most Referenced Guides
- (Add links as you create guides)

### Key Research
- (Add links as you complete research)

### Quick Reference Notes
- (Add links to frequently accessed notes)

**Remember:** Documentation is a gift to your future self. Be generous.
